# Simple JavaScript Calculator

## Description

This project is a simple calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project was created as a portfolio piece to demonstrate fundamental web development skills, including DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.

## Key Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Performs addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), and division (/).
- **Clear Functionality (AC):** Clears the display and resets the calculator.
- **Decimal Input:** Allows for decimal numbers.
- **Positive/Negative Toggle (+/-):** Changes the sign of the current number.
- **Percentage Calculation (%):** Calculates the percentage of the current number.
- **Error Handling:** Basic error handling for division by zero.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean and intuitive design.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the Repository:** If you haven't already, clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

    _(Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the GitHub repository)_

2.  **Open `index.html`:** Navigate to the project directory in your file explorer and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
