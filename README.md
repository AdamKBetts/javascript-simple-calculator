# Simple Calculator

This is a basic calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides fundamental arithmetic operations and some additional features.

## Features Implemented

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (\*), Division (/)
- **Clear Functions:**
  - **AC (All Clear):** Clears the entire calculation.
  - **CE (Clear Entry):** Clears the current input.
- **Decimal Input:** Allows for calculations with decimal numbers.
- **Equals Button (=):** Calculates and displays the result.
- **Plus/Minus (+/-):** Changes the sign of the current input.
- **Percentage (%):** Calculates the percentage of the current input (note: this implementation might differ from advanced calculators).
- **Square Root (âˆš):** Calculates the square root of the current input.
- **Display Limit:** Limits the number of digits displayed to prevent overflow.
- **Rounding of Results:** Rounds the result of calculations to a maximum of 6 decimal places.
- **Memory Functions:**
  - **MC (Memory Clear):** Clears the stored memory value.
  - **MR (Memory Recall):** Recalls the value stored in memory and displays it.
  - **M+ (Memory Add):** Adds the current input to the value in memory.
  - **M- (Memory Subtract):** Subtracts the current input from the value in memory.
- **Inverse (1/x):** Calculates the reciprocal of the current input.
- **Keyboard Input:** Allows users to interact with the calculator using their keyboard.
- **Improved Button Layout:** Uses CSS Grid for a more organized and user-friendly button arrangement.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone or Download:** If you have the project in a repository, clone it to your local machine. Otherwise, download the project files.
2.  **Open `index.html`:** Navigate to the project directory and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3.  **Perform Calculations:** Use the buttons on the calculator (or your keyboard) to enter numbers and perform operations. The result will be displayed in the input field at the top.

## Files Included

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the calculator's layout.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the appearance of the calculator.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic and functionality of the calculator.

## Potential Future Enhancements

- Implementing order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).
- Adding more advanced mathematical functions (trigonometric, exponential, etc.).
- Improving the visual design and user interface.
- Adding more robust error handling.
- Implementing unit tests to ensure functionality.
- Deploying the calculator online.
